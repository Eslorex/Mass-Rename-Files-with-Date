# Questions #

## How does renaming work?
- It renames all the files depending on the parent folder's name. 
- Naming format is like: "Parent Folder Name" - 13 April 2024.
- If there are multiple folders with the same last changed date, it will name the most recent one with an increased number, such as "Parent Folder Name" - 13 April 2024 - 2.

## How does the one without UI work?
- It's actually faster. It will rename the ones that are in the same directory with it.

## Why .pyw? 
- To prevent the console screen from appearing when using the one with UI.

## Why Parent Folder's name?
- To show the project name.

## What are the use cases?
- You can use it basically for a small level of version control.
- For example, if you're the type of person who is naming his project files like "asdgj, project1, untitled" etc., you can give them a proper name depending on their date and parent folder (basically project name).
- So let's say you're making music called "MISTED". You can create a folder called "MISTED", save multiple versions of project files when working on it, then mass rename them with this tool. So you will have organized file names also mentioning the project name and date.
