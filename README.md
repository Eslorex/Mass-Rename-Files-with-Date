# How does renaming work?
- It renames all the files depending on the parent folders name.

- If there are multiple folders with same last changed date it will name the recent one increased number. Such as "Parent Folder Name" - 13 April 2024 - 2

# Why .pyw? 
- It prevents console screen to appear when using the one with UI

# Why Parent Folder's name?
- To show the project name

# What are the use cases?
- You can use it basically for small level of version control.
- For example if you're a type of person who is naming his project files like "asdgj, project1, untitled" etc. You can give them a proper name depending on their date and parent folder (basically project name).
- So lets say you're making a music called "MISTED". You can create a folder called "MISTED", save multiple version of project files when working on it, then mass rename it with this tool. So you will have organized file names also mentioning the project name and date.
